# Self-Taught Software & AI Learning Roadmap (4 Years)

This repository documents my long-term self-taught journey in software development and applied artificial intelligence.

It is structured as a multi-year learning plan focused on building strong fundamentals first, followed by increasingly complex systems, projects, and real-world applications.

The goal of this repository is not speed, but depth, consistency, and long-term skill growth.

---

## Repository Structure

The repository is divided into two main areas:

### 🔹 Fundamentals
Contains practice scripts and exercises focused on core programming concepts.

Topics include:
- Variables and data types
- Conditionals and loops
- Functions
- Data structures
- Error handling
- Core Python concepts

This folder represents deliberate practice and experimentation while learning the foundations.

### 🔹 Projects
Contains complete and documented projects.

Each project:
- Has a clear purpose
- Uses structured and readable code
- Includes a README explaining its logic and design decisions

Projects increase in complexity over time and are occasionally refactored as skills improve.

## 🗺️ Long-Term Learning Plan Overview

### Year 1 – Programming Foundations
- Python fundamentals
- Problem-solving and logic
- Writing clean and readable code
- Small terminal-based projects
- Git and GitHub basics

### Year 2 – Software Development Fundamentals
- More complex Python projects
- Data structures and algorithms
- Code refactoring and modularity
- Introduction to software design principles
- Basic testing and debugging practices

### Year 3 – Applied AI, LLMs & Data Systems
Focus on understanding and working with modern AI systems, including:

- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Tokenization and text representations
- Model training processes (pretraining, fine-tuning, RLHF)
- Model sizes, parameters, and trade-offs
- Information Retrieval fundamentals
- Chunking strategies and embeddings
- Retrieval methods (dense, sparse, hybrid)
- Vector databases
- Basic MLOps concepts
- Advanced prompt engineering
- Building small LLM-powered applications

### Year 4 – Integration & Real-World Systems
- End-to-end projects
- Scalable system design
- Combining software engineering with AI components
- Maintaining and improving existing projects
- Applying learned concepts to practical problems

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository exists to:
- Track long-term progress
- Reinforce learning through practice
- Build a solid foundation before specialization
- Document growth through code, not certificates

It is a living repository that will evolve as skills and understanding improve.

---

## Philosophy

- Focus on fundamentals before tools
- Prefer depth over speed
- Learn by building and refactoring
- Treat learning as a long-term process

---

## Notes

- Early projects may be simple by design.
- Code quality improves progressively over time.
- Refactoring older projects is part of the learning process.
