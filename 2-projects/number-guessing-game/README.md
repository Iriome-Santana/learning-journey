# Number Guessing Game (Python)

Terminal-based number guessing game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a limited number of attempts.

## Features
- Random number generation
- Configurable range and maximum attempts
- Input validation with error handling
- Feedback for each guess (too high / too low)
- Game over message when attempts run out

## How It Works
The program generates a random number between a defined minimum and maximum value.
The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the number.

After each attempt, the program provides feedback until:
- The correct number is guessed, or
- The maximum number of attempts is reached


## Technologies
- Python 3
- random module

## Purpose
This project was created to practice:
- Loops and conditionals
- Exception handling (`try/except`)
- Input validation
- Clean control flow
- Writing readable and maintainable Python code
